# NaiveGAExperiments

Just a bunch of experiments to test ideas for [NaiveGAflux](https://github.com/DrChainsaw/NaiveGAflux.jl).

## Lamarckism

[Notebook](lamarckism/experiments.ipynb) with some experiments on the usefulness of lamarckism, i.e. the idea that new models to the largest extent possible keep the weights from their parents. 

## Fitness noise

[Notebook](fitnessnoise/experiments.ipynb) with some experiments on the effects of fitness noise and how to mitigate it
